# How to ask for help?

#### What you can do:
- *During presentations*: Use the Teams chat to ask questions
- *During exercises*: Put an X in the purple column of the [status chart](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X1btpp99IgslvqtuNew0Igcpe6y6_T_phVqzNSosX-0/edit#heading=h.8nqh57o1bbwx) (with an optional explanation of your question)

#### What we will do:
- Answer your question in writing; right there, right then.
- Invite you to an individual google hangout, where someone can assist you.

#### Also: use the status chart when you are done with an exercise!

# What is R?

.left-column[
![rlogo](images/rlogo.png)]

.right-column[

- A widely used programming language for data analysis

- Based on statistical programming language S (1976)

- Developed by **R**oss Ihaka & **R**obert Gentleman (1995)

- Very active community, with many (often subject-specific) packages

- Open source, and interoperable!

# We will work in Rstudio

![rstudiologo](images/rstudiologo.png)

- **I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment (IDE) for R

- Founded by J.J. Allaire, available since 2010

- Bloody useful! Let’s take a look: please open RStudio!

# Running R code

#### In a script/Rmarkdown document
- Place your cursor in the line of code you want to execute

- Press ![run](images/run.png) or ctrl + enter

- When running multiple lines: select all lines, then press ‘Run’ or ctrl+enter

#### In an Rmarkdown document
- You can execute a chunk as a whole with the green triangle:

# Exercise 0: running your first code

_Before you start: make sure you have downloaded the course materials, and unzipped them to a single, accessible folder._

1. In Rstudio, choose **File** > **Open Project**

1. Navigate to the folder with course materials

1. Open **introduction-to-R-and-data-github.Rproj**

1. From the ‘files’ menu (bottom right), select **baseR_exercises.Rmd**

1. Run the R code in Exercise 0 

1. When you are done: place an X in the green column of the [status chart](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X1btpp99IgslvqtuNew0Igcpe6y6_T_phVqzNSosX-0/edit?usp=sharing).

# R syntax & the console

### - Data types in R
### - Using functions
### - Combining data
### - Indexing data

---
# Always distinguish:

Giving R information:
```{r}
x <- 1
```
Asking R a question:
```{r}
x
```

Note:
- Answers on our slides will be preceded with `##`; not the case in your console
- Answers (both in the console and on the slide) are indexed with `[i]`
- The assignment operator in R is a 'carrot-stick' or arrow: <-

#### Also: We will have plenty of exercises, so you can focus on the slides when we present!

---
# Which are these?

#### Giving information, or asking a question?

### 1: 
```{r}
4 + 5
```
--

### 2: 
```{r}
var <- 73
```
--

### 3: 
```{r}
var/x
```

# Variable assignment

.pull-left[
You can assign both numbers and text to a variable:

```{r}
x <- 6

x <- 'apple'

x <- "hello world"

x = 6
```

![assignment](images/assignment.png)]

.pull-right[

#### (in course materials folder **cheatsheets/**)]

# Maths functions

.pull-left[
You can perform math with your variables:
```{r}
x * 3
```
and store the results as new variables:
```{r}
y <- x + 2

log2(y)
```

# Exercise 1

1. Do the following calculation in R: _1 plus 5, divided by 9_

2. Assign the result of the calculation to a variable.

1. (Bonus) Round off the result to 1 decimal.
    
    _Tip: Use the Maths Functions section of your cheat sheet!_

# Exercise 1

1. Do the following calculation in R: _1 plus 5, divided by 9_
    ```{r}
    (1+5)/9
    ```

2. Assign the result of the calculation to a variable.
    ```{r}
    x <- (1+5)/9
    ```

1. (Bonus) Round off the result to 1 decimal.
    ```{r}
    round(x,1)
    ```

---
# Another data type: logical

.pull-left[A logical is `True` or `False`, and can also be written as `T` or `F`.

```{r}
TRUE
FALSE
T
F
```
]

--

.pull-right[Logicals are mostly used as tests:

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| == | `==`  |is equal to |
| != | `!=` | is not |
| >= | `>=` | larger than or equal to |
| < | `<`  | smaller than |

```{r}
x==6
x!=10
2>4
```
