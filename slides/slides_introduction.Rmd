- Ask for help when you need it, and alert us when we need to slow down!

--

- Please mute yourself when you are not speaking.

--

- Close as many unnecessary windows and programs as possible.

--

- Take a computer break when we take a break: a timer will show when we return!

# R syntax & the console

## - Data types in R
## - Using functions
## - Combining data
## - Indexing data

---
# Always distinguish:

Giving R information:
```{r}
x <- 1
```
Asking R a question:
```{r}
x
```

Note:
- Answers on our slides will be preceded with `##`; not the case in your console
- Answers (both in the console and on the slide) are indexed with `[i]`
- The assignment operator in R is a 'carrot-stick' or arrow: <-

#### Also: We will have plenty of exercises, so you can focus on the slides when we present!

# Which are these?

### 1: 
```{r}
4 + 5
```

### 2: 
```{r}
var <- 73
```
--

### 3: 
```{r}
var/x
```
