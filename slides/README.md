## Slides for Introduction to R and Data

The slides for this workshop are developed in PowerPoint, and exported to pdf.
They are specific to the course given at Utrecht University, although deleting a few pdf pages should fix that.
If you want to make more elaborate edits, you can download the slides' powerpoint files here:
