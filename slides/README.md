## Slides for Introduction to R and Data

The slides for this workshop are developed in PowerPoint, and exported to pdf.
They are specific to the course given at Utrecht University, although deleting a few pdf pages should fix that.
If you want to make more elaborate edits, you can [download the slides' powerpoint files on our Surfdrive](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/3NzQUPpkijYeXJz).
