## Workshop description

R is a powerful scripting language for data handling, data visualization, and
statistics. In this workshop, we aim to give you the tools to start exploring
R and all it has to offer by yourself.

The course will take you from the very basics in R syntax, to data handling
and visualization using a set of tools known as the ‘tidyverse’. Not only
that, we will take some time to understand datasets and their architecture,
preparing you to handle your own data in a clean, robust, and reproducible
manner. We will work in RStudio and introduce R as well as R Markdown: this is
a great way to combine code and its output with text, allowing you to code in
a narrative and intuitive way. Moreover, this way you produce a human-readable
document with which you can easily share and showcase your work.
