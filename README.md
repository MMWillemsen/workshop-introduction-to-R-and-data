# Workshop: Introduction to R & data

This repository contains the documentation, exercises and datasets of the
single day workshop 'Introduction to R & data' at [Utrecht
University](https://www.uu.nl). The workshop is organised by [Research Data
Management Support](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management).

## Upcoming course dates
The next workshops will be given on:

- [Friday, June 14th, 2019](https://www.uu.nl/en/events/introduction-to-r-data-6) (FULL)

Registration is mandatory; check the link for the workshop you are interested in for information on how to register or be put on the waiting list.

## Workshop description

R is a powerful scripting language for data handling, data visualization, and
statistics. In this workshop, we aim to give you the tools to start exploring
R and all it has to offer by yourself.

The course will take you from the very basics in R syntax, to data handling
and visualization using a set of tools known as the ‘tidyverse’. Not only
that, we will take some time to understand datasets and their architecture,
preparing you to handle your own data in a clean, robust, and reproducible
manner. We will work in RStudio and introduce R as well as R Markdown: this is
a great way to combine code and its output with text, allowing you to code in
a narrative and intuitive way. Moreover, this way you produce a human-readable
document with which you can easily share and showcase your work.

- Exercises Part II: Modern R with Tidyverse [modernR_exercises.Rmd](modernR_exercises.Rmd)
- Solutions Part II: Modern R with Tidyverse [modernR_solutions.Rmd](modernR_solutions.Rmd) | [.pdf](modernR_solutions.pdf)

**External resources**

- Book: [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
- [R cheat sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) provided by the R community and RStudio, describing common procedures and packages. We use the following cheat sheets during our workshop:
    - [Base R](http://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/base-r.pdf)
    - [R Markdown](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/#rmarkdown)
    - [Data Import](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/#import)
    - [Data Visualization with ggplot2](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/#ggplot2)
    - [Data Transformation with dplyr](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/#dplyr)

**Data**
- The dataset [data/HUJI_Crane_israel_GPRS.csv](data/HUJI_Crane_Israel_GPRS.csv) was generously provided by Sasha Pekarsky, and is the result of work done at the Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel. 
- The dataset [data/crane_additional_observations.xlsx](data/Crane_additional_observations.xlsx) is fictional.

## Installation requirements
This course requires three things to be installed:
- The language **R**
- The IDE **Rstudio**
- The packages in **tidyverse**
Information on how to install these (and troubleshoot the installation) is on our [installation guide](installation.md).
