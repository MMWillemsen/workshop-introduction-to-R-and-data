# R Cheatsheets

The R community and RStudio provide so-called R cheatsheets. These 2-page cheatsheets describe common procedures and packages. You can find an overview of cheatsheets at [rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/). The cheatsheets used during this workshop can be found in this folder.
